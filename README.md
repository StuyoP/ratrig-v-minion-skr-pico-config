# ratrig-v-minion-skr-pico-config
Configuration file that 3d nero configured in his video series on how to flash klipper to any any 3d printer. It has tested to be working, but it is always good idea to double check everything.

Took the orioginal file from gkayttajag and spliced it with a V-Minion default configuration from RatOS 2.1 (with another controller). Still to be tested.
Cetup includes as follows:
1. SKR Pico Control Board
2. Raspberry Pi Zero2w
3. Superpinda probe
4. Orbited 2.0 extruder
5. Orbiter runout sensor
6. Sensorless homing
7. Phaetus Drgonfly BMO hotend
8. HDMI 4.0" screen with touch

Still need to finish assembling the printer, but RPI sees the SKR control board so only cables are left to be connected and hoppefully it will print.
